### eTagger - Watch Out for Energy Patterns! Towards TaggingEnergy Sensitive GitHub Issues

<!-- You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tritims/eTagger/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tritims/eTagger/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

 ## Tool Description
 
eTagger is a Chrome extension that labels energy sensitive issues from Android projects on GitHub with energy patterns associated with the issue. The goal of eTagger is to make both the developers and the maintainers of the project aware of the energy efficiency when they take up the issues raised in the project, thereby increasing their adoption and making the projects more energy efficient.
